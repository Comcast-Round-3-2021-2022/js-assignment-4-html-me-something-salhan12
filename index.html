         Cappadocia is a living example of just how odd yet beautiful nature can be. It presents a fantasy-like landscape that looks like it‚Äôs been plucked out of a fairy tale, alien-like hills and boulders that seem as if they‚Äôve been transported from another planet. The humans who once lived here used the area‚Äôs soft stone to create underground shelters, leaving all kinds of weird architectural wonders in their wake. The lunar landscape is stunning on its own, but the countless hot-air balloons that fill up the sky with shades of red, yellow, orange and cream simply take its beauty to the next level. The Goreme Open Air Museum and its rock-cut churches and the subterranean wonders of Kaymakli are among the best things to see in Cappadocia.

            <img src="Images/Grand Canyon National Park, USA.jpeg" alt="">

            <p>
            There‚Äôs a reason more than 5 million people choose to visit the Grand Canyon each year. It‚Äôs one of the most magical destinations on the planet. Irrespective of how much you read about the Grand Canyon, you‚Äôre sure to end up being spellbound, for nothing prepares you for the magical sight that this wonder has to offer. Considered to rank among one of the top 7 wonders of the world, this fascinating piece of art feels strikingly familiar, yet entirely unique. Its sheer size leaves you speechless and visiting the canyon during sunrise or sunset leaves you mesmerized because the scenery on display is so serene, so beautiful, so pure. The canyon is divided into three rims, North, West and South, and all three offer incredibly unique experiences. The South Rim is the most visited feature of the Canyon for it hosts a majority of the regions infrastructure, Native American ruins, viewpoints and historic artefacts. However, if you‚Äôre after adventure and solitude, the North Rim is where you need to be.

            You might suddenly start believing in fairies the moment your eyes fall on the Fairy Pool, an ethereal oasis that bewitches visitors with its crystal clear water, picture-perfect scenery and magical atmosphere. The waters are freezing, but if you‚Äôre searching for wild swimming adventures, it truly doesn‚Äôt get better than this. And if you‚Äôre not as adventurous, a mere walk around the area, exploring aqua blue pools, each more appealing than the other, is sure to leave you in high spirits. The place also has its own infinity pool, bounded by a beautiful stone wall!

          There‚Äôs the great Machu Picchu, the so-called lost civilization of the Incas. Machu Picchu was built around the year 1450 and was occupied for almost 100 years before the Spanish Conquest. This mesmerizing city was never discovered by the Spaniards and was literally forgotten until the early 20th century, meaning that most of its architectural wonders still remain intact. The hike up the hills is an adventure in itself, and this mysterious city looks most beautiful from the Inca Trail lookout point.

            Lastly, one of the most photogenic places in New Zealand is actually a movie set ‚Äî Hobbiton, from the popular ‚ÄòLord of the Rings‚Äô series! Hobbiton village was filmed on green farmlands in the North Island of New Zealand, and fans will be thrilled to know that they‚Äôve kept the entire movie set from the Shire intact for people to tour. The current Shire movie set you see today has 44 hobbit homes, farms, and gardens, and covers 5 hectares (12 acres)!

            Each of these places leave you speechless with their beauty, mystery and ingenuity, making you wonder just how many secrets this beautiful planet still has in store for us. Exploring the most beautiful places in the world is a time-consuming affair, for there are so many destinations that could make your list, but each experience is sure to be incredible, fascinating and extremely rewarding. I personally can not wait to visit these places! Especially, The Hobbiton as I am a huge fan of The Lord Of The Rings/The Hobbit Movies.
